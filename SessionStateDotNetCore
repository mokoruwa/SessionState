Session state exhibits the following behaviors:

The session cookie is specific to the browser. Sessions aren't shared across browsers.
Session cookies are deleted when the browser session ends.
If a cookie is received for an expired session, a new session is created that uses the same session cookie.
Empty sessions aren't retained. The session must have at least one value set to persist the session across requests. When a session isn't retained, a new session ID is generated for each new request.
The app retains a session for a limited time after the last request. The app either sets the session timeout or uses the default value of 20 minutes. Session state is ideal for storing user data:
That's specific to a particular session.
Where the data doesn't require permanent storage across sessions.
Session data is deleted either when the ISession.Clear implementation is called or when the session expires.
There's no default mechanism to inform app code that a client browser has been closed or when the session cookie is deleted or expired on the client.
Session state cookies aren't marked essential by default. Session state isn't functional unless tracking is permitted by the site visitor. For more information, see General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) support in ASP.NET Core.
Note: There is no replacement for the cookieless session feature from the ASP.NET Framework because it's considered insecure and can lead to session fixation attacks.
